# 🚗 Used Car Price Prediction — Regression & Regularisation

## 📌 Overview  
This project builds a data-driven model to predict used car prices using regression techniques.  
It focuses on both **predictive accuracy** and **model interpretability**, applying **Ridge and Lasso regularisation** to improve generalisation.

⚠️ **Dataset note:** The dataset is not included in this repository due to size/licensing constraints.
